# HSV-Maritime-Vessel-Clasification

This repository contains a dataset utilized in a research project detailed in the conference paper titled "Ship Type Classification: a Handwriting Signature Verification Approach for Maritime Trajectories".

The associated paper presents an in-depth analysis and proposals of AI-based methodologies for the classification of vessel types based on their trajectory analysis. The research involved training multiple AI models using processed and labeled data derived from raw AIS data.

The dataset comprises multiple maritime trajectories obtained by processing kinematic parameters extracted from recorded AIS messages. These trajectories were encoded into 600x450 RGB images, facilitating a unique representation for further analysis. Additionally, a CSV file containing ship class labels is provided, enabling seamless pairing of trajectory data with corresponding vessel types.
